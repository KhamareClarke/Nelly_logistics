  # Create reviews table for Nelly's Logistics

  Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up the reviews table.

  1. New Tables
    - `reviews`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier for each review
      - `name` (text, required) - Name of the reviewer
      - `rating` (int2, required) - Rating from 1 to 5 stars
      - `comment` (text, required) - Review comment text
      - `published` (boolean, default false) - Whether review is published on site
      - `created_at` (timestamptz, default now()) - Timestamp of review submission

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `reviews` table
    - Add policy for public read access to published reviews only
    - Add policy for public insert (submissions start unpublished)
    - Add policy for authenticated users to manage all reviews (for admin moderation)

  3. Constraints
    - Rating must be between 1 and 5
    - Comment limited to 500 characters
